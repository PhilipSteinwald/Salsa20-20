/*  General structure was taken from the tutrial in week 07.
*   We have adapted the function to read the contents of the file into a struct
*   which contains an array for the string and a field for the number of bytes in
*   that array. This is done because the process of encrypting a message may generate
*   '\0' bytes which would lead to the encrypted char* to be a shorter message than the
*   original string. This would make it impossible to recover the original message by
*   applying the same algorithm to the encrypted message.
*
*   Important: On success the function returns a pointer to a dynamically allocated struct
*   which also contains a dynamically allocated array to to the string. In case the struct
*   is no longer needed the allocated memory has to be freed in the correct order:
*       - First free struct.str
*       - Then free struct itself
